       "'Follow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X Data Science Interview Questions  \\n \\nStatistics:  \\n1. What is the Central Limit Theorem and wh y is it important ? \\n“Suppose that we are interested in estimating the average height among all people. Collecting data for \\nevery person in the world is impossible. While we can’t obtain a height measurement from everyone in the \\npopulation, we can still sample some people. The  question now becomes, what can we say about the \\naverage height of the entire population given a single sample. The Central Limit Theorem addresses this \\nquestion exactly.”  Read more  here . \\n2. What is sampling? How many sampling methods do you know ? \\n“Data sampling is a statistical analysis technique used to select, manipulate and analyze a representative \\nsubset of data points to identify patterns and trends in the l arger data set being examined.”  Read the full \\nanswer  here . \\n3. What is the difference between type I vs type II error ? \\n“A type I error occurs when the null hypo thesis is true, but is rejected.  A type II error occurs when the null \\nhypothesis is false, but erroneously fails to be rejected.”  Read the full answer  here . \\n4. What is linear regression? What do the terms p -value, coefficient, and r -squared \\nvalue mean? What is the significance of each of these components ? \\nA linear regression is a good tool for quick predictive analysis: for example, the price o f a house depends \\non a myriad of factors, such as its size or its location. In order to see the relationship between these \\nvariables, we need to build a linear regression, which predicts the line of best fit between them and can \\nhelp conclude whether or no t these two factors have a positive or negative relationship.  Read \\nmore  here  and here.  \\n5. What are the assumptions required for linear regression ? \\nThere are four major assumptions: 1. There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and \\nthe regres sors, meaning the model you are creating actually fits the data, 2.

What is Selection Bias?  \\nSelection bias is a kind of error that occurs when the researcher decides who is going to be studied. It is \\nusually associated wit h research where the selection of par ticipants isn’t random.  It is sometimes referred to \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X as the selection effect. It is the distortion of statistical analysis, resulting from the method of collecting \\nsamples. If the selection bias is not taken into account , then some conclusions of the study may not be \\naccurate.  \\nThe types of selection bias include:  \\n1. Sampling bias : It is a systematic error due to a non -random sample of a population causing some \\nmembers of the population to be less likely to be included than others resulting in a biased sample.  \\n2. Time interval : A trial may be terminated early at an extreme value (often for ethical reasons), but the \\nextreme value is likely to be reached by the variable with the largest variance, even if all variable s \\nhave a similar mean.  \\n3. Data : When specific subsets o f data are chosen to support a conclusion or rejection of bad data on \\narbitrary grounds, instead of according to previously stated or generally agreed criteria.  \\n4. Attrition : Attrition bias is a kind of sele ction bias caused by attrition (loss of participants ) discounting \\ntrial subjects/tests that did not run  to completion.  \\nQ3. What is bias -variance trade -off? \\nBias:  Bias is an error introduced in your model due to oversimplification of the machine learning al gorithm. \\nIt can lead to underfitting. When you train  your model at that time model makes simplified assumptions to \\nmake the target function easier to understand.  \\nLow bias machine learning algorithms — Decision Trees, k -NN and SVM High bias machine learning  \\nalgorithms — Linear Regression, Logistic Regression  \\nVariance:  Variance is error introduced in your model due to complex machine learning algorithm, your model \\nlearns noise also from the training data set and performs badly on test data set. It can lead to  high sensitivity \\nand overfitting.  \\nNormally, as you increase the complexity of your model, you will see a reduction in error due to lower bias \\nin the model. However, this only happens until a particular point. As you continue to make your model more \\ncomple x, you end up over -fitting your model and hence your  model will start suffering from high variance.  \\n \\nBias -Variance trade -off: The goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to have low bias and \\nlow variance to achieve good prediction performance . \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X 1. The k -nearest neighbour algorithm has low bias and  high variance, but the trade -off can be changed \\nby increasing the value of k which increases the number of neighbours that contribute to the prediction \\nand in turn increases the bias of the model.  \\n2. The su pport vector machine algorithm has low bias and high  variance, but the trade -off can be \\nchanged by increasing the C parameter that influences the number of violations of the margin allowed \\nin the training data which increases the bias but decreases the var iance.  \\nThere is no escaping the relationship between  bias and variance in machine learning. Increasing the bias \\nwill decrease the variance. Increasing the variance will decrease bias.  \\nQ4. What is a confusion matrix?  \\nThe confusion matrix is a 2X2 table that  contains 4 outputs provided by the  binary classifie r.

What is the difference between “long” and “wide” format data?  \\nIn the  wide -format , a subject’s repeated re sponses will be in a single row, and each response is in a \\nseparate column.  In the  long -format , each row is a one -time point per subject.  You can recognize data in \\nwide forma t by the fact that columns generally represent groups.  \\n \\nQ6. What do you understan d by the term Normal Distribution?  \\nData is usually distributed in different ways with a bias to the left or to the right or it can all be jumbled up.  \\nHowever, there are chances that data is distributed around a central value without any bias to the left or  right \\nand reaches normal distribution in the form of a bell -shaped curve.  \\n \\nFigure:  Normal distribution in a bell curve  \\nThe random variables are distributed in the form  of a symmetrical, bell -shaped curve.  \\nProperties of Normal Distribution are as follows;  \\n1.

Correlation measures how stro ngly two variables are \\nrelated.  \\nCovariance : In covariance two items vary together and it’s a measure that indicates the extent to which two \\nrandom variables change in cy cle. It is a statistical term; it explains the systematic relation between a pair of \\nrandom variables, wherein changes in one variable reciprocal by a corresponding change in another \\nvariable.  \\nQ8. What is the difference between Point Estimates and Confiden ce Interval?  \\nPoint Estimation gives us a particular value as an estimate of a populatio n parameter. Method of Moments \\nand Maximum Likelihood estimator methods are used to derive Point Estimators for population parameters.  \\nA confidence interval gives us a r ange of values which is likely to contain the population parameter. The \\nconfidence inte rval is generally preferred, as it tells us how likely this interval is to contain the population \\nparameter. This likeliness or probability is called Confidence Level or  Confidence coefficient and represented \\nby 1 — alpha, where alpha is the level of signi ficance.  \\nQ9.

What is p -value?  \\nWhen you perform a hypothesis test in statistics, a p -value can help you determine the strength of your \\nresults. p -value is a number between 0 and 1. Based on the value it will denote the strength of the results. \\nThe claim which is on trial is called the Null Hypothesis.  \\nLow p -value (≤ 0.05) indicates strength against the null hypothesis which means we can reject the null \\nHypothesis. High p -value (≥ 0.05) indicates strength for the null hypothesis which means we can a ccept the \\nnull Hypothesis p -value of 0.05 indicates the Hypothesis could go either way. To put it  in another way,  \\nHigh P values: your data are likely with a tr ue null. Low P values: your data are unlikely with a true null.  \\nQ11.

How can you generate a random number between 1 – 7 with only a die?  \\n• Any die has six sides from 1 -6. There is no way to get seven equal outco mes from a single rolling of \\na die.  If we roll the die twice and consider the event of two rolls, w e now have 36 different outcomes.  \\n• To get our 7 equal outcomes we have to reduce this 36 to a number divisible by 7. We can thus \\nconsider only 35 outcomes and  exclude the other one.  \\n• A simple scenario can be to exclude the combination (6,6), i.e., to roll th e die again if 6 appears twice.  \\n• All the remaining combinations from (1,1) till (6,5) can be divided into 7 parts of 5 each. This way all \\nthe seven sets of ou tcomes are equally likely.  \\nQ13. A certain couple tells you that they have two children, at least on e of which is a girl.

Can you cite some examples where a false positive is important than a false negative?  \\nLet us first understand what false positives and false negatives are.  \\n• False Positives  are the cases where you wrongly classified a non -event as an event a.k.a Type I \\nerror.  \\n• False Negatives  are the cases where you wrongly classify events as non -events, a.k.a Type II error.  \\nExample 1:  In the medical field, assume you have to  give chemotherapy to patients. Assume a patient \\ncomes to that hospital and he is tested positive for cancer, based on the lab prediction but he actually doesn’t \\nhave cancer. This is a case of false positive. Here it is of utmost danger to start chemothera py on this patient \\nwhen he actually does not have cancer. In the absence of cancerous cell, chemotherapy will do certain \\ndamage to his normal healthy cells and might lead to severe diseases, even cancer.  \\nExample 2:  Let’s say an e -commerce company decided t o give $1000 Gift v oucher to the customers whom \\nthey assume to purchase at least $10,000 worth of items.

The final result is a tree w ith decision nodes and leaf \\nnodes. A decision tree can handle both categorical and numerical data.  \\n \\nQ49. What are Entropy and Information gain in Decision tree al gorithm?  \\nThe core algorithm for building a decision tree is called  ID3. ID3 uses  Entropy  and Information Gain   \\nEntropy  \\nA decision tree is built top -down from a root node and involve partitioning of data into homogenious \\nsubsets.  ID3 uses enteropy to check the homogeneity of a sample. If the sample is completely homogenious \\nthen entropy is zero and  if the sample is an equal ly divided it has entropy of one.  \\n \\nInformation Gain  \\nThe Information Gain  is based on the decrease in entropy after a dataset is split on an attribute. \\nConstructing a decision tree is all about finding attributes that return the h ighest information gain.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X  \\n \\nQ50. What is pruning in Decision Tree?  \\nPruning  is a technique in machine learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of  decision \\ntrees  by removing sections of the  tree that provide little power to classify instances. S o, when we remove \\nsub-node s of a decision node, this process is called  pruning  or opposite process of splitting.  \\nQ51. What is logistic regression? State an example whe n you have used logistic \\nregression recently.  \\nLogistic Regression  often referred to as the logit model is a technique to predict the binary outcome from \\na linear combination of predictor var iables.   \\nFor example, if you want to predict whether a particular political leader will win the election or not.  In this \\ncase, the outcome of prediction is binary i.e. 0 or 1 (Win/Lose). The predictor variables here would be the \\namount of m oney spent for e lection campaigning of a particular candidate, the amount of time spent in \\ncampaigning, etc.  \\nQ52. What is Linear Regression?  \\nLinear regression  is a statist ical technique w here the score of a variable Y is predicted from the score of a \\nsecond variable X. X is referred to as the predictor variable and Y as the criterion variable.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X  \\nFollow me for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X \\nQ53. What Are the Drawbacks of the Linear Model?  \\nSome drawbacks of the linear m odel are:  \\n• The assumption of linearity of the errors.  \\n• It can’t be used for count outcomes or binary outcomes  \\n• There are overfitting problems that it can’t solve  \\nQ54. What is the difference between Regression and classification ML techniques?  \\nBoth Regression and classification machine learning techniques come under  Supervised machine \\nlearning algorithms . In Supervised machine learning algorithm, we have to train the model using labelled \\ndata set, While training we have to explicitly provide the correct labels and algorithm tries to learn the pattern \\nfrom input to output. If our labels are discrete values then it will a classification problem, e.g A,B etc. but if \\nour labels are continuous values then it will be a regression problem, e.g 1.23, 1.333 etc.  \\nQ55. Wha t are Recommender Systems?  \\nRecommender Systems  are a subclass of information filtering systems that are meant to predict the \\npreference s or ratings that a user would give to a product.  Recommender systems are widely used in movies, \\nnews, research articles, products, social tags, music, etc.  \\nExamples include movie recommenders in IMDB, Netflix & BookMyShow, product recommenders in e -\\ncommer ce s ites like Amazon, eBay & Flipkart, YouTube video recommendations and game \\nrecommendations in Xbox.  \\nQ56. What is Collaborative filtering?  \\nThe process of filtering used by most of the recommender systems to find patterns or information by \\ncollaborating v iewpoints, various data sources and multiple agents.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X  \\nAn example of collaborative filtering can be to predict the rating of a particular user based on his/her ratings \\nfor other movies and others’ ratings for all movies. This concept is widely used in reco mmen ding movies in \\nIMDB, Netflix & BookMyShow, product recommenders in e -commerce sites like Amazon, eBay & Flipkart, \\nYouTube video recommendations and game recommendations in Xbox.  \\nQ57. How can outlier values be treated?  \\nOutlier values can be identified b y using univariate or any other graphical analysis method.  If the number of \\noutlier values is few then they can be assessed individually but for a large number of outliers, the values can \\nbe substituted with either the 99th or the 1st percentile values.  \\nAll extreme values are not outlier values.  The most common ways to treat outlier values  \\n1. To change the value and bring it within a range.  \\n2. To just remove the value.  \\nQ58. What are the various steps involved in an analytics project?  \\nThe following are the various  steps involved in an analytics project : \\n1. Understand the Business problem  \\n2. Explore the data and become familiar with it.  \\n3. Prepare the data for modelling by detecting outliers, trea ting missing values, transforming variables, \\netc. \\n4. After data preparation, start running the model, analyze the result and tweak the approach. This is an \\niterative step until the best possible outcome is achieved.  \\n5. Validate the model using a ne w data set.  \\n6. Start implementing the model and track the result to analyze the performance of the model over the \\nperiod of time.  \\nQ59. During analysis, how do you treat missing values?  \\nThe extent of the missing values is identified after identifying the varia bles with miss ing values.  If any \\npatterns are identified the analyst has to concentrate on them as it could lead to interesting and meaningful \\nbusiness insights.  \\nIf there are no patterns identified, then the missing values can be substituted with mean or m edian values \\n(imputation) or they can simply be ignored.  Assigning a default value which can be mean, minimum or \\nmaximum value. Getting into the data is important.  \\nIf it is a categorical variable, the default value is assigned. The missing value is assigne d a default va lue. If \\nyou have a distribution of data coming, for normal distribution give the mean value.  \\nIf 80% of the values for a variable are missing then you can answer that you would be dropping the variable \\ninstead of treating the missing values.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X Q60. How will y ou define the number of clusters in a clustering algorithm?  \\nThough the Clustering Algorithm is not specified, this question is mostly in reference to  K-Means \\nclusteri ng where “K” d efines the number of clusters.  The objective of clustering is to group similar entities \\nin a way that the entities within a group are similar to each other but the groups are different from each other.  \\nFor example, the following image shows t hree different  groups.   \\nWithin Sum of \\nsquares is generally used to explain the homogeneity within a cluster. If you plot WSS for a range of number \\nof clusters, you will get the plot shown below.  \\n \\n• The Graph is generally known as  Elbow Curve . \\n• Red circled a  point in abov e graph i.e.  Number of Cluster =6  is the point after which you don’t see \\nany decrement in WSS.  \\n• This point is known as the  bending  point and taken as K in K – Means.  \\nThis is the widely used approach  but few data scientists also use Hierarchical clustering f irst to create \\ndendrograms and identify the distinct groups  from there.  \\nQ61. What is Ensemble Learning?  \\nEnsemble Learning is basically combining a diverse set of learners(Individual models) togethe r to improvise \\non the stability and predictive power of the  model.  \\nQ62. Describe in brief any type of Ensemble Learning?  \\nEnsemble learning has many types  but two more popular ensemble learning techniques are mentioned \\nbelow.  \\nBagging  \\nBagging tries to implement similar learners on small sample populations and then t akes a mean of all the \\npredictions. In generalised bagging, you can use different learners on different population. As you expect \\nthis helps us to reduce the variance error.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X  \\nBoosting  \\nBoosting  is an iterative technique which adjusts the weight of an observation base d on the last \\nclassification.  If an observation was classified incorrectly, it tries to increase the weight of this observation \\nand vice versa. Boosting in genera l decreases the bias error and builds strong predictive models. However, \\nthey may over fit on the training data.  \\n \\nQ63. What is a Random Forest? How does it work?  \\nRandom fores t is a versatile machine learning method capable of performing both regression and \\nclassifica tion tasks. It is also used for dimensionality reduction, treats missing values, outlier values. It is a \\ntype of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak m odels combine to form a powerful model.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X In Random Forest, we grow multiple trees as opposed t o \\na single tree. To classify a new object based on attributes, each tree gives a classification. The forest \\nchooses the classification having the most  votes (Overa ll the trees in the forest) and in case of regression, \\nit takes the average of  outputs by diff erent trees.  \\nQ64. How Do You Work Towards a Random Forest?  \\nThe underlying principle of this technique is that several weak learners combined to provide a keen \\nlearner. The steps involved are  \\n• Build several decision trees on bootstrapped training samples of data  \\n• On each tree, each time a split is considered, a random sample of mm predictors is chosen as split \\ncandidates, out of all pp predictors  \\n• Rule of thumb: At eac h split m=p√m=p  \\n• Predictions: At the majority rule  \\nQ65. What cross -validation techni que would you use on a time series data set?  \\nInstead of using k -fold cross -validation, you should be aware of the fact that a time series is not randomly \\ndistributed data — It is inherently ordered by chronological order.  \\nIn case of time series data, you s hould use techniques like forward=chaining — Where you will be model \\non past data then look at forward -facing data.  \\nfold 1: training[1], test[2]  \\nfold 1: training[1 2], test[ 3] \\nfold 1: training[1 2 3], test[4]  \\nfold 1: training[1 2 3 4], test[5]  \\nQ66. What is a Box -Cox Transformation?  \\nThe dependent variable for a regression analysis might not satisfy one or more assumptions of an ordinary \\nleast squares regression. The residuals could either curve as the prediction increases or follow the skewed \\ndistribu tion. In such scenarios, it is necessary to transform the response variable so that the data meets \\nthe required assumptions. A Box cox transformation is a statistical technique to transform non -normal \\ndependent variables into a normal shape. If the given d ata is not normal then most of the statistical \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X techniques assume normality.

T he Box -Cox transformation is named \\nafter statisticians  George Box  and Sir Da vid Roxbee Cox  who collaborated on a 1964 paper and \\ndeveloped the technique.  \\nQ67. How Regularly Must an Algorithm be Updated?  \\nYou will want to update an algorithm when:  \\n• You want th e model to evolve as data streams through infrastructure  \\n• The underlying data source is changing  \\n• There is a case of non -stationarity  \\n• The algorithm underperforms/ results lack accuracy  \\nQ68. If you are having 4GB RAM in your machine and you want to train your  model on \\n10GB data set. How would you go about this problem?  Have you ever faced this kind of \\nproblem in your machine learning/data science experience so far?  \\nFirst of all, you have to ask which ML model you want to train.  \\nFor Neural networks:  Batch size with Numpy array will work.  \\nSteps:  \\n1. Load the whole data in the Numpy array. Numpy array has a property to create a mapping of the \\ncomplete data set, it doesn’t load complete data set in memory.  \\n2. You can pass an index to Numpy array to get required data.  \\n3. Use this data to pass to the Neural net work.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X 4.

So, you could check out the  best laptop for \\nMachine Learning  to prevent that. Having said that, l et’s move on to some questions on d eep learning.  \\n  \\nDEEP LEARNING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS  \\nQ69. What do you mean by Deep Learning?   \\nDeep Learning  is nothing but a paradigm of mach ine learning which has shown incred ible promise in recent \\nyears. This is because of the fact that Deep Learning shows a great analogy with the functioning of the \\nhuman brain.  \\nQ70. What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning?  \\nMachine l earning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being \\nexplicitly programmed. Machine learning can be categorised in the following three categories.  \\n1. Supervised machine learning,  \\n2. Unsupervised machine learning,  \\n3. Reinfor cement learning  \\nDeep Learning is a \\nsubfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain \\ncalled artificial neural networks.  \\nQ71. What, in your opinion, is the reason for the popularity of Deep Learning in recent \\ntimes?  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X Now although Deep Learning has been around for many years, the major breakthroughs from these \\ntechniques came just in recent years.  This is because of two main reasons:  \\n• The increase in the amount of data generated through various sources  \\n• The growth in hardware resources required to run these models  \\nGPUs are multiple times faster and they help us build bigger and deeper deep learning models in \\ncomparatively less time than we required previously.  \\nQ72. What is reinforcement le arning?  \\n  \\nReinforcement Learning  is \\nlearning what to do and how to map situations to actions. The end result is to maximise the numerical reward \\nsignal. The learner is not told which acti on to take but in stead must discover which action will yield the \\nmaximum reward. Reinforcement learning is inspired by the learning of human beings, it is based on the \\nreward/penalty mechanism.  \\nQ73. What are Artificial Neural Networks?  \\nArtificial Neural ne tworks are a spec ific set of algorithms that have revolutionized machine learning. They \\nare inspired by biological neural networks.  Neural Networks  can adapt to changing the i nput so the netwo rk \\ngenerates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.  \\nQ74. Describe the structure of Artificial Neural Networks?  \\nArtificial Neural Networks works on the same principle as a biological Neural Network. It con sists of inputs \\nwhich get processed with weighted sums and Bias, with the help of Activation Functions.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X  \\nQ75. How Are Weights Initialized in a Network?  \\nThere are two methods here: we can either initialize the weights to zero or assign them randomly.  \\nInitializing all weigh ts to 0: This makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every layer \\nperform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless.  \\nInitializing all weights randomly: Here, the weights are assigned randomly by init ializing them very close to \\n0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the most \\ncommonly used method.  \\nQ76. What Is t he Cost Function?  \\nAlso referred to as “loss” or “error,” cost function is a measur e to evaluate how good your model’s \\nperformance is. It’s used to compute the error of the output layer during backpropagation. We push that error \\nbackwards through the neural network and use that during the different training functions.  \\nQ77. What Are Hyper parameters?  \\nWith neural networks, you’re usually working with  hyperparameters  once the data is formatted correctly. A \\nhyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set b efore the learning process begins. It determines how a \\nnetwork is trained and the struct ure of the network (such as the number of hidden units, the learning rate, \\nepochs, etc.).  \\nQ78. What Will Happen If the Learning Rate Is Set inaccurately (Too Low or Too  High)?  \\nWhen your learning rate is too low, training of the model will progress very slo wly as we are making minimal \\nupdates to the weights. It will take many updates before reaching the minimum point.  \\nIf the learning rate is set too high, this causes unde sirable divergent behaviour to the loss function due to \\ndrastic updates in weights. It m ay fail to converge (model can give a good output) or even diverge (data is \\ntoo chaotic for the network to train).  \\nQ79. What Is the Difference Between Epoch, Batch, and  Iteration in Deep Learning?  \\n• Epoch – Represents one iteration over the entire dataset (e verything put into the training model).  \\n• Batch – Refers to when we cannot pass the entire dataset into the neural network at once, so we \\ndivide the dataset into several batches.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X • Iteration – if we have 10,000 images as data and a batch size of 200. then an e poch should run 50 \\niterations (10,000 divided by 50).  \\nQ80. What Are the Different Layers on CNN?  \\nThere are four layers in  CNN : \\n1. Convolutional Layer –  the layer that perfo rms a convolutional operation, creating several smaller \\npicture windows to go over the data.  \\n2. ReLU Layer – it brings non -linearity to the network and converts all the ne gative pixels to zero. The \\noutput is a rectified feature map.  \\n3. Pooling Layer – pooling is  a down -sampling operation that reduces the dimensionality of the feature \\nmap.  \\n4. Fully Connected Layer – this layer recognizes and classifies the objects in the image.  \\nQ81. What Is \\nPooling on CNN, and How Does It Work?  \\nPooling is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of a CNN. It performs down -sampling operations to reduce \\nthe dimensionality and creates a pooled feature map by sliding a filter matrix over the input matrix . \\nQ82. What are Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs)?  \\nRNNs  are a type of artificial neural networks designed to recognise  the pattern from the sequence of data \\nsuch as Time series, stock market and government agencies etc. To understand recurrent nets, first, you \\nhave to understand the basics of feedforward nets.  \\nBoth these networks RNN and feed -forward named after the way they channel information through a series \\nof mathematical orations performed at the nodes of the network. One feeds information through \\nstraight(n ever touching the same node twice), while the oth er cycles it through a loop, and the latter are \\ncalled recurrent.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X  \\nRecurrent networks, on the other hand, take as their input, not just the current input example they see, but \\nalso the what they have percei ved previously in time.  \\nThe decision a recurrent neural network reached at time t -1 affects the decision that it will reach one moment \\nlater at time t. So recurrent networks have two sources of input, the present and the recent past, which \\ncombine to deter mine how they respond to new data, much as we do in life.  \\nThe error they generate will return via backpropagation and be used to adjust their weights until error can’t \\ngo any lower. Remember, the purpose of recurrent nets is to accurately classify sequenti al input. We rely on \\nthe backpropagation of error  and gradient descent to do so.  \\nQ83. How Does an LSTM Network Work?  \\nLong -Short -Term Memory (LSTM)  is a special kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning l ong-\\nterm dependencies, remembering information for long periods as its default behaviour. There are three \\nsteps in an LSTM network:  \\n• Step 1:  The network decides what to forget and what to remember.  \\n• Step 2:  It selectively updates cell state values.  \\n• Step 3:  The network decides what part of the current state makes it to the output.  \\nQ84. What Is a Multi -layer Perceptron(MLP)?  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X As in  Neural Networks, MLPs  have an input layer, a hidden  layer, and an output layer. It has the \\nsame  structure as a single layer  perceptron  with one or more hidden layers. A si ngle layer perceptron can \\nclassify only linear separable classes with binary output (0,1), but MLP can classify nonlinear classes.  \\nExcept for the input layer, each node in the other \\nlayers uses a nonlinear activation function. This means the input layers,  the data coming in, and the \\nactivation function is based upon all nodes and weights being added together, producing the output. MLP \\nuses a supervised learning method called “backpropagation.” In  backpropagation , the neural  network \\ncalculates the error with the help of cost function. It propagates this error backward from where it came \\n(adjusts the weights to train the model more accurately).  \\nQ85. Explain Gradient Descent.  \\nTo Understan d Gradient Descent, Let’s understand wha t is a  Gradient  first. \\nA gradient  measures how much the output of a function changes if you change the inputs a little bit. It \\nsimply measures  the change in all weights with regard t o the change in error. You can also think of a \\ngradient as the slope of a function.  \\nGradient Descent  can be thought of climbing down to the bottom of a valley, instead of climbing up a \\nhill.  This is because it is a minimization algorithm that minimizes a given function ( Activation Function ). \\nQ86. What is \\nexploding gradients?  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X While training an RNN, if you see  exponentially growing (very large) error gradients  which  accumulate \\nand result in very large updates to neura l network model weights during training, they’re known as \\nexploding gradients. At an extreme, the values of weights can become so large as to overflow and result in \\nNaN values.  \\nThis has the effect of your model is unstable and unable to learn from your tra ining data.  \\nQ87. What is vanishing gradients?  \\nWhile training an RNN, your slope can become either too small; this makes the training difficult. When the \\nslope is too small, the problem is known as a Vanishing Gradient. It leads to long training times, poor  \\nperformance, and low accuracy.  \\nQ89. What is Back Propagation and Explain it’s Working.  \\nBackpropagation  is a training algorithm used for multilayer neural network. In this method, we move the \\nerror from an end of the network to all weights inside the network and thus allow ing efficient computation of \\nthe gradient.  \\nIt has the following steps:  \\n \\n \\nData Scientis t Masters Program  \\nWeekday / Weekend Batches See Batch Details  \\n \\n• Forward Propagation of Training Data  \\n• Derivatives are computed using output and target  \\n• Back Propagate for computing derivative of error  wrt output activation  \\n• Using previously calculated derivati ves for output  \\n• Update the Weights  \\nQ90. What are the variants of Back Pr opagation?  \\n• Stochastic Gradient Descent:  We use only a single training example for calculation of gradient and \\nupdate parameters.  \\n• Batch Gradient Descent:  We calculate the gradient for th e whole dataset and perform the update at \\neach iteration.  \\n• Mini-batch Gradient Descent : It’s one of the most popular optimization algorithms. It’s a variant of \\nStochastic Gradient Descent and here instead of single training example, mini -batch of samples is  \\nused.  \\nQ91.

What is an Auto -Encoder?   \\nAuto -enco ders  are simple learning networks that aim to transform inputs into outputs with the minimum \\npossible error. This means that we want the output to be as close to input as  possible. We add a couple of \\nlayers between the input and the output, and the sizes of these layers are smaller than the input layer.

What Is the Difference Between Bat ch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient \\nDescent?  \\nBatch Gradient Descent  Stochastic Gradient Descent  \\nThe batch gradient computes the gradient using the \\nentire dataset.  The stochastic gradient computes the gradient using \\na single sample.  \\nIt takes time to converge because the volume of data \\nis huge, and weights update slowly.

Split the node into daughter nodes using the best split  \\n4. Repeat steps two and three until leaf nodes are finalized   \\n5. Build forest by repeating steps one to four for \\'n\\' times to create \\' n\\' number of trees   \\n105. How can you avoid the overfitting your model?  \\nOverfitting refers to a model that is only set for a very small amount of data and ignores the bigger picture. \\nThere are three main methods to avoid overfitting:  \\n1. Keep the model simple —take fewer variables into account, thereby removing some of the noise in the \\ntraining data  \\n2. Use cross -validation techniques, such as k folds cross -validation   \\n3. Use regularization techniques, such as LASSO, that penalize certain model parameters if they\\'re likel y \\nto cause overfitting  \\n106. Differentiate between univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X Univariate   \\nUnivariate data contains only one variable. The purpose of the univariate analysis is to describe the data \\nand find patterns that exist within it.   \\nExample: height of students   \\nHeight (in cm)  \\n164 \\n167.3  \\n170 \\n174.2  \\n178 \\n180 \\nThe patterns can be studied by drawing conclusions using mean, median, mode, dispersion or range, \\nminimum, maximum, etc.  \\nBivariate   \\nBivariate data involves two different variable s. The analysis of this type of data deals with causes and \\nrelationships and t he analysis is done to determine the relationship between the two variables.  \\nExample: temperature and ice cream sales in the summer season  Follow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X Temperature (in Celcius)  Sales  \\n20 2,000 \\n25 2,100  \\n26 2,300  \\n28 2,400  \\n30 2,600  \\n36 3,100  \\nHere, the relationship is visible from the table that temperature and sales are directly proportional to each \\nother. The hotter the temperature, the better the sales.  \\nMultivariate   \\nMultivariate data invo lves three or more variables, it is categorized under  multivariate. It is similar to a \\nbivariate, but contains more than one dependent variable.  \\nExample: data for house price prediction   \\nNo. of rooms  Floors  Area (sq ft)  Price  \\n2 0 900 $4000,00  Follow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X 3 2 1,100  $600,000  \\n3.5 5 1,500  $900,000  \\n4 3 2,100  $1,200,000  \\nThe patterns can be studied by drawing conclusions using mean, median, and mode, dispersion or range, \\nminimum, maximum, etc. You can start describing the data and using it to guess what the price of the \\nhouse will be.  \\n107. What are the feature se lection methods used to select the right variables?  \\nThere are two main methods for feature selection:  \\nFilter Methods  \\nThis involves:   \\n• Linear discrimination analysis  \\n• ANOVA  \\n• Chi-Square  \\nThe best analogy for selecting fea tures is \"bad data in, bad answer out.\" When we\\'re limiting or selecting \\nthe features, it\\'s all about cleaning up the data coming in.   \\nWrapper Methods   \\nThis involves:   \\n• Forward Selection : We test one feature at a time and k eep adding them until we get a goo d fit \\n• Backward Selection : We test all the features and start removing them to see what works better  \\n• Recursive Feature Elimination : Recursively looks through all the different features and how they pair \\ntogether  \\nWrapper met hods are very labor -intensive, and  high-end computers are needed if a lot of data analysis is \\nperformed with the wrapper method.   \\n108. In your choice of language, write a program that prints the numbers ranging from \\none to 50.  Follow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X But for multiples of three, pri nt \"Fizz\" instead of the number an d for the multiples of five, print \"Buzz.\" For \\nnumbers which are multiples of both three and five, print \"FizzBuzz\"   \\nThe code is shown below:  \\n \\nNote that the range mentioned is 51, whi ch means zero to 50. However, the range asked in the question is \\none to 50. Therefore, in the above code, you can include the range as (1,51).  \\nThe output of the above code is as shown:  \\n \\n109. You are given a data set consisting of variables with more than 30 percent missing \\nvalues. How will you deal with them?  \\nThe following are ways to  handle missing data values:  \\nIf the data set is large, we can just simply remove the rows with missing data values. It is the quickest way; \\nwe use the rest of the data to predict the values.  \\nFor smaller data sets, we can substitute missing values wi th the mean or average of the rest o f the data \\nusing pandas data frame in python. There are different ways to do so, such as df.mean(), df.fillna(mean).  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X 110. For the given points, how will you calculate the Euclidean distance in Python?  \\nplot1 = [1,3]  \\nplot2 = [2,5]  \\nThe Euclidean distance can b e calculated as follows:  \\neuclidean_distance = sqrt( (plot1[0] -plot2[0])**2 + (plot1[1] -plot2[1])**2 )  \\n111. What are dimensionality reduction and its benefits?  \\nDimensionality reduction refers to  the process of converting a  data set with vast dimensions into data \\nwith fewer  dimensions (fields) to convey similar information concisely.   \\nThis reduction helps in compressing data and reducing storage space. It also reduces computation time as \\nfewer dim ensions lead to less computi ng. It removes redundant features; for example, there\\'s no point in \\nstoring a value in two different units (meters and inches).   \\n112. How will you calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following 3x3 matrix?  \\n-2 -4 2 \\n-2 1 2 \\n4 2 5 \\nThe characteristic  equation is as shown:  \\nExpanding determinant:  \\n(-2 – λ) [(1 -λ) (5-λ)-2x2] + 4[( -2) x (5 -λ) -4x2] + 2[( -2) x 2 -4(1-λ)] =0  \\n- λ3 + 4λ2 + 27λ – 90 = 0,  \\nλ3 - 4 λ2 -27 λ + 90 = 0  \\nHere we have an algebraic equation built from the eigenvectors.  \\nBy hit and trial:  Follow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X 33 – 4 x 32 - 27 x 3 +90 = 0  \\nHence, (λ - 3) is a factor:  \\nλ3 - 4 λ2 - 27 λ +90 = (λ – 3) (λ2 – λ – 30) \\nEigenvalues are 3, -5,6: \\n(λ – 3) (λ2 – λ – 30) = (λ – 3) (λ+5) (λ -6), \\nCalculate eigenvector for λ = 3  \\nFor X = 1,  \\n-5 - 4Y + 2Z =0,  \\n-2 - 2Y + 2Z =0  \\nSubtracting  the two equations:   \\n3 + 2Y = 0,  \\nSubtracting back into second equation:  \\nY = -(3/2)  \\nZ = -(1/2) \\nSimilarly, we can calculate the eigenvectors for -5 and 6.  \\n113. How should you  maintain a deployed model?  \\nThe steps to maintain a deployed model are:  \\nMonitor   \\nConstant monitoring of all models is needed to determine their performance accuracy. When you change \\nsomething, you want to figure out how your changes are going to affect thi ngs. This needs to be monitored \\nto ensure it\\'s doing what it\\'s supposed to do.  \\nEvalu ate   \\nEvaluation metrics of the current model are calculated to determine if a new algorithm is needed.   \\nCompare   Follow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X The new models are compared to each other to determine which model performs the best.   \\nRebuild   \\nThe best performing model is re -built on the c urrent state of data.  \\n114. What are recommender systems?  \\nA recommender system predicts what a user would rate a spe cific product based on their preferences. It \\ncan be split into two different areas:  \\nCollaborative filtering   \\nAs an example, Last.fm recommends  tracks that other users with similar interests play often. This is also \\ncommonly seen on Amazon after making a pu rchase; customers may notice the following message \\naccompanied by product recommendations: \"Users who bought this also bought…\"  \\nContent -based filtering  \\nAs an example: Pandora uses the properties of a song to recommend music with similar properties. Here, \\nwe look at content, instead of looking at who else is listening to music.  \\n115. How do you find RMSE and MSE in a linear regression model?  \\nRMSE a nd MSE are two of the most common measures of accuracy for a linear regression model.   \\nRMSE indicates the Root Mea n Square Error.   \\n \\nMSE indicates the Mean Square Error.  \\n \\n116. How can you select k for k -means?   \\nWe use the elbow method to select k for k -means clustering. The idea of the elbow method is to run k -\\nmeans clustering on the data set where \\'k\\' is the number of clusters.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X Within the sum of squares (WSS), it is defined  as the sum of the squared distance between each member \\nof the cluster and its centr oid.  \\n117. What is the significance of p -value?  \\np-value typically ≤ 0.05  \\nThis indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis; so you reject the null hypothesis.  \\np-value typically > 0.05  \\nThis indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you  accept the null hypothesis.   \\np-value at cutoff 0.05   \\nThis is considered to be marginal, meaning it could go either way.  \\n118. How can outlier values be treated?  \\nYou can drop outliers only if it is a garbage value.   \\nExample: height of an adult = abc ft. This  cannot be true, as the height cannot be a string valu e. In this \\ncase, outliers can be removed.  \\nIf the outliers have extreme values, they can be removed. For example, if all the data points are clustered \\nbetween zero to 10, but one point lies at 100, then we can remove this point.  \\nIf you cannot drop outliers,  you can try the following:  \\n• Try a different model. Data detected as outliers by linear models can be fit by nonlinear models. \\nTherefore, be sure you are choosing the correct model.  \\n• Try normalizing the d ata. This way, the extreme data points are pulled to a  similar range.  \\n• You can use algorithms that are less affected by outliers; an example would be random forests.   \\n119. How can a time -series data be declared as stationery?  \\nIt is stationary when the varian ce and mean of the series are constant with time.   \\nHere is a visual example:   Follow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X  \\nIn the first graph, the variance is constant with time. Here, X is the time factor and Y is the variable. The \\nvalue of Y goes through the same points all the time; in other wor ds, it is stationary.  \\nIn the second graph, the waves get bigger, which means it is non -stationary and the variance is changing \\nwith time.  \\n120. How can you calculate accuracy using a confusion matrix?  \\nConsider this confusion matrix:  \\n \\nYou can see the values for total data, actual values, and predicted values.  \\nThe formula for accuracy is:  \\nAccuracy = (True Positive + True Negative) / Total Observations  \\n  = (262 + 347) / 650  \\n  = 609 / 650  \\n  = 0.93  \\nAs a result, we get an accuracy of 93 percent.  \\n121. Write the equa tion and calculate the precision and recall rate.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X Consider the same confusion matr ix used in the previous question.  \\n \\nPrecision = (True positive) / (True Positive + False Positive)  \\n    = 262 / 277  \\n    = 0.94  \\nRecall Rate = (True Positive) / (Total Positive + False Negative)  \\n        = 262 / 288  \\n        = 0.90  \\n122. \\'People who bought this also bought…\\' recommendations seen on Amazon are a \\nresult of which algorithm?  \\nThe recommendation engine is accomplished with collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering e xplains the \\nbehavior of other users and their purchase history in terms of ratings, selection, etc.   \\nThe engine makes predictions on what might interest a person based on the preferences o f other users. In \\nthis algorithm, item features are unknown.  \\n  \\nFor example, a sales page shows that a certain number of people buy a new phone and also buy \\ntempered glass at the same time. Next time, when a person buys a phone, he or she may see a \\nrecommendation to buy tempered glass as well.  \\n123. What is a Generative Adversarial Network?  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X Suppose there is a wine shop purchasing wine from dealers, which they resell later. But some dealers sell \\nfake wine. In this case, the shop ow ner should be able to distinguish between fake and authentic wine . \\nThe forger will try different techniques to sell fake wine and make sure specific techniques go past the shop \\nowner’s check. The shop owner would probably get some feedback from wine expert s that some of the wine \\nis not original. The owner would have to improve how he determines whether a wine is fake or authentic.  \\nThe forger’s goal is to create wines that are indistinguishable from the authentic ones while the shop owner \\nintends to tell if the wine is real or not accurately  \\nLet us understand this example with the help of an image.  \\nThere is a noise vector coming into the \\nforger who is generating fake wine.  \\nHere the forger acts as a Generator.  \\nThe shop owner acts as a Discriminator.  \\nThe Discr iminator gets two inputs; one is the fake wine, while the other is the real authentic wine. The shop \\nowner has to figure out whether it is real or fake.  \\nSo, there are two primary components of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) named:  \\n1. Generator  \\n2. Discrimin ator \\nThe generator is a CNN that keeps keys producing images and is closer in appearance to the real images \\nwhile the discriminator tries to determine the difference between real and fake images The ultimate aim is to \\nmake the discriminator learn to identi fy real and fake images.  \\nApart from the very technical questions, your interviewer could even hit you up with a few simple ones to \\ncheck your overall confidence, in the likes of the following.  \\n124. You are given a dataset on cancer detection. You have built a classification model \\nand achieved an accuracy  of 96 per cent. Why shouldn\\'t you be happy with your model \\nperformance? What can you do about it?  \\nCancer detection results in imbalanced data. In an imbalanced dataset, accuracy should not be based as a \\nmeasure of performance. It is important to focus on t he remaini ng four percent, which represents the \\npatients who were wrongly diagnosed. Early diagnosis is crucial when it comes to cancer detection, and \\ncan greatly improve a patient\\'s prognosis.  \\nFollow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X Hence, to evaluate model performance, we should use  Sensitivit y (True Po sitive Rate), Specificity (True \\nNegative Rate), F measure  to determine the class wise performance of the classifier.  \\n125. Which of the following machine learning algorithms can be used for inputting \\nmissing values of both categorical and continuou s variable s? \\n• K-means clustering  \\n• Linear regression   \\n• K-NN (k -nearest neighbor)  \\n• Decision trees   \\nThe K nearest neighbor algorithm can be used because it can compute the nearest neighbor and if it \\ndoesn\\'t have a value, it just computes the nearest neighbor based on all t he other features.   \\nWhen you\\'re dealing with K -means clustering or linear regressio n, you need to do that in your pre -\\nprocessing, otherwise, they\\'ll crash. Decision trees also have the same problem, although there is some \\nvariance.  \\n126. Below are the eight actual values of the target variable in the train file. What is the \\nentropy of the target variable?  \\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]   \\nChoose the correct answer.  \\n1. -(5/8 log(5/8) + 3/8 log(3/8))  \\n2. 5/8 log(5/8)  + 3/8 log(3/8)  \\n3. 3/8 log(5/8) + 5/8 log(3/8)  \\n4. 5/8 log(3/8) – 3/8 log(5/8)  \\nThe target variable, in this case, is 1.   \\nThe formula for calculating the entropy is:  \\nPutting p=5 and n=8, we get   \\nEntropy = A = -(5/8 log(5/8) + 3/8 log(3/8))  \\n127.

In machine \\nlearning, feature vectors are used to represent numeric or symbolic characteristic s (called features) of an \\nobject in a mathematical way that\\'s ea sy to analyze.   \\n132. What are the steps in making a decision tree?  \\n1. Take the entire data set as input.  \\n2. Look for a split that maximizes the separation of the classes. A split is any test that div ides the data into \\ntwo sets.  \\n3. Apply the split to the input data ( divide step).  \\n4. Re-apply steps one and two to the divided data.  \\n5. Stop when you meet any stopping criteria.  \\n6. This step is called pruning. Clean up the tree if you went too far doing splits.  \\n133. Wha t is root cause analysis?  \\nRoot cause analysis was initially developed to analyze industrial accidents but is now widely used in other \\nareas. It is a problem -solving tec hnique used for isolating the root causes of faults or problems. A factor is \\ncalled a ro ot cause if its deduction from the problem -fault-sequence averts the final undesirable event from \\nrecurring.  \\n134. What is logistic regression?  \\nLogistic regression is als o known as the logit model. It is a technique used to forecast the binary outcome \\nfrom a linear combination of predictor variables.  \\n135. What are recommender systems?  \\nRecommender systems are a subclass of information filtering systems that are meant to pred ict the \\npreferences or ratings that a user would give to a product.  \\n136. Explain cross -validation.  Follow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X Cross -validation is a model validation technique for evaluating how the outcomes of a statistical analysis \\nwill generalize to an independent data set. It is m ainly used in backgrounds where the objective is to \\nforecast and one wants to estimat e how accurately a model will accomplish in practice.   \\nThe goal of cross -validation is to term a data set to test the model in the training phase (i.e. validation data \\nset) to limit problems like overfitting and gain insight into how the model will general ize to an independent \\ndata set.  \\n137. What is collaborative filtering?  \\nMost recommender systems use this filtering process to find patterns and information by collaborating \\nperspectives, numerous data sources, and several agents.  \\n138. Do gradient descent meth ods always converge to similar points?  \\nThey do not, because in some cases, they reach a local minima or a local optima point. You would not \\nreach the global optima point. This is governed by the data and the starting conditions.  \\n139. What is the goal of A/B  Testing?  \\nThis is statistical hypothesis testing for randomized experiments with two variables, A and B. The objective \\nof A/B testing is to detect any changes to a web pag e to maximize or increase the outcome of a strategy.  \\n140. What are the drawbacks of th e linear model?  \\n• The assumption of linearity of the errors  \\n• It can\\'t be used for count outcomes or binary outcomes  \\n• There are overfitting problems that it can\\'t solve  \\n141. What is the law of large numbers?  \\nIt is a theorem that describes the result of performin g the same experiment very frequently. This theorem \\nforms the basis of frequency -style thinking. It states that the sample mean, sample variance and sample \\nstandard deviation converge to what they are t rying to estimate.  \\n142.  What are the confounding vari ables?  \\nThese are extraneous variables in a statistical model that correlates directly or inversely with both the \\ndependent and the independent variable. The estimate fails to account for the confounding factor.  \\n143. What is star schema?  \\nIt is a traditional  database schema with a central table. Satellite tables map IDs to physical names or \\ndescriptions and can be connected to the central fact table using the ID fields; these tables are known as Follow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X lookup table s and are principally useful in real -time applicatio ns, as they save a lot of memory. Sometimes, \\nstar schemas involve several layers of summarization to recover information faster.  \\n144. How regularly must an algorithm be updated?  \\nYou will want to update an algorithm when:  \\n• You want the model to evolve as dat a streams through infrastructure  \\n• The underlying data source is changing  \\n• There is a case of non -stationarity  \\n145.  What are eigenvalue and eigenvector?  \\nEigenvalues are the directio ns along which a particular linear transformation acts by flipping, compressi ng, \\nor stretching.  \\nEigenvectors are for understanding linear transformations. In data analysis, we usually calculate the \\neigenvectors for a correlation or covariance matrix.   \\n146. Why is resampling done?  \\nResampling is done in any of these cases:  \\n• Estimating  the accuracy of sample statistics by using subsets of accessible data, or drawing randomly \\nwith replacement from a set of data points  \\n• Substituting labels on data points when perfo rming significance tests  \\n• Validating models by using random subsets (bootstrapping, cross -validation)  \\n147.

Follow Steve N ouri for more AI and Data science posts: https://lnkd.in/gZu463 X Survivorship bias is the logical error of focusing on aspects that support surviving a process and casually \\noverlooking those that did  not because of their lack of prominence. This can lead to wrong conclusions in \\nnumerous ways.  \\n150. How do you work towards  a random forest?  \\nThe underlying principle of this technique is that several weak learners combine to provide a strong \\nlearner. The s teps involved are:  \\n1. Build several decision trees on bootstrapped training samples of data  \\n2. On each tree, each time a split is  considered, a random sample of mm predictors is chosen as split \\ncandidates out of all pp predictors  \\n3. Rule of thumb: At each split m=p √m=p  \\n4. Predictions: At the majority rule  \\n \\n151.
